Nudge tweaks website designs to make them less persuasive, turns off notifications, alerts you to addictive browsing patterns, and gives you tools to manage some of the most addictive parts of the internet — e.g. to delete your Facebook News Feed.

- Get nudged every 15 minutes on an addictive site, or when you quit the site but compulsively return straight away

- Avoid annoying notifications in tab titles ('(1)' and red dots designed to bring you back)

- Save hundreds of hours of your life by deleting your Facebook News Feed forever, across all devices, with Nudge's auto-unfollowing tool

- Enjoy websites with some of their most distracting features hidden unless you choose to show them (nominations welcome for features to hide by default - email feedback@nudgeware.io)

- Be part of a science-driven experiment to make the internet a healthier, less addictive place

- Choose the sites Nudge works on and more in Options
